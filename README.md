# Hakumai

## What is Hakumai?
Hakumai is a rice organization system.
It currently supports colorschemes for urxvt.

## Planned features
See [TODO](https://github.com/SkyCorp/Hakumai/blob/master/TODO).

## Install instructions:
Add the following lines to .Xresources

`#include /path/to/colorscheme/`

Example: $HOME/.hakumai/colors/vacuous

`#include /path/to/.hakumai/lib/rainbow`

NOTE: This MUST come after your colorscheme.

## Others
Feel free to submit feedback! And as always, use the issues tracker if you run into any nasty bugs.

Notes: included under `bin/` is `kaleidoscope`, a tool to convert colorschemes from Xresources format to Hakumai.

`kaleidoscope` is still very new and has bugs, please report any you find.
